## Overview
This package demonstrates a basic publisher/subscriber example in ROS. The publisher sends out a pre-determined message, which is received and displayed by the subscriber. The example follows teh tutorials on http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/ExaminingPublisherSubscriber. The code follows Google style guide, and C++11 features.

## Assumptions & Dependencies
This code was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04.6 using ROS Kinetic. We are assuming that your catkin workspace ~/catkin_ws is already initialized.

## Installing and Building Instructions
Run the following commands in the terminal:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lydiazoghbi/beginner_tutorials.git
```
To build the workspace, run:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
```

## Running the Demo
In a new terminal, launch ROS through:
```
roscore
```
To start publishing data, open a second terminal, and type the following:
```
cd ~/catkin_wd
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials talker
```
You should be able to see a custom message printed at a fixed rate in the terminal. To read (subscribe) to the publisher, open a third terminal and type:
```
cd ~/catkin_wd
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun beginner_tutorials listener
```
You now should see the custom message that was published on the subscriber terminal.

## Running the Demo from the Launch file
Close the talker and listener terminals from the previous section. Leave roscore running, or initialize it if you haven't done that already. In a new terminal, type the following:
```
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch beginner_tutorials fileLaunch.launch
```
This will automatically launch both listeners and talkers. If you wish to modify the rate at which the information is being published, you can do so by adding an additional argument to roslaunch as follows:
```
roslaunch beginner_tutorials fileLaunch.launch rate:=5
```
Error or warning messages will appear if you select a negative, null or too high of a frequency.

## Running the Demo with a Subscriber
If you wish to modify the string published by the talker, you can do so through a subscriber embedded in the code. Follow instructions in the Demo using Launch file, and in a new terminal type the following:
```
source devel/setup.bash
rosservice call /string_modifier <string>
```
Replace <string> with any string you wish. If you go to the terminal where the launch file was used, the string output must have changed.
